## Life-Expectancy and Income in Australia

A small study investigating whether there exists a link between family income and life-expectancy in Australian in the present day. Do wealthier Australians still live longer since the Hawke government introduced Medicare in 1984 granting all residents a right to universal healthcare?

This study formed a part of my assessment for **COMP20008: Element of Data Processing** at the University of Melbourne. I later expanded it with hypothesis testing for the sake of curiosity.
